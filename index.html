<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This book is for you if you are looking for a simple yet effective way to write electronic documents. It shows you how to write your work using Markdown, which is designed for writing an easy-to-read formatted text that can be converted into different formats such as HTML, PDF, DOCX, and more. Once you have mastered the basics of writing with Markdown, you can focus on your work, write on any editor, and convert your text to beautiful documents.</p>
<p>At present, there are a lot of ways to write documents on computers, ranging from simple to full-fledged WYSIWYG editors. While these editors are useful, the files generated are usually not compatible with each other and they may not be available on all computing platforms. Therefore, depending on a single editor to write could limit the way you work.</p>
<p>With Markdown, you not only can simplify the way you write but also have the freedom to write using any editor or platform you preferred. Generally, a Markdown document is simply a plain text file with some non-intrusive markup instructions. Therefore, you can focus on your work and write really fast. Furthermore, since the files are just plain text, you can version control them. This feature not only allows you to keep track of changes in your work but also serves as a backup of your work.</p>
<h2 id="why-markdown">Why Markdown?</h2>
<p>So, what makes Markdown so special as a formatting language for writing your work? First of all, Markdown has a very simple syntax that you can learn to write quickly. As a Markdown document is just a plain text file with lightweight markup symbols, it is <strong>fast</strong> to write yet easy to read.</p>
<p>Second, Markdown’s formatting syntax is very clean, as it was designed to be readable from the beginning. Therefore, you can <strong>focus</strong> on writing without being distracted by any complicated formatting syntaxes.</p>
<p>Last, using Markdown to write gives you enormous <strong>flexibility</strong>. As a Markdown document is simply plain text, you can edit it using any editor you preferred. With Markdown, writing and formatting are two separate steps. Therefore, you only have to write documents once but have the flexibility to convert them to different formats. Furthermore, you can put your documents under any version control system you preferred.</p>
